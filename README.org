#+title: A defensive and fast decompression library in pure Common Lisp
#+options: ^:{}

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overview
:END:

The title speaks for itself. I originally wrote the Deflate part of this library
as a fun exercise in implementing something purely from the specification, but
it ended up good enough to publish. Patching existing libraries would have been
difficult due to different API promises.

More formats may be added later; obvious candidates are xz and zstd. A
compressor counterpart is highly unlikely. A download can be found [[https://semelz.de/downloads/][here]]; there
is also a [[https://github.com/se-mz/decompress][Github mirror]] if you're into that.



** Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: features
:END:

- *Supported formats*: Deflate, zlib, gzip, bzip2.

- *Safety*: All [[#edge-cases][edge cases]] are properly detected and explicitly
  handled; malformed data is rejected early. The interface is designed to be
  hard to misuse; in particular, defaults try to provide the strongest
  guarantees and built-in integrity checks are run without user intervention.
  Memory usage is at most linear (and usually constant) with respect to input
  size. No FFI is used anywhere.

- *No overreads by default*: If the compressed data is well-formed and taken
  from a byte stream, then no byte beyond the end of the compressed data will be
  read, allowing this library to be used as a part of complicated stream
  processing for other formats. This can be explicitly relaxed in the name of
  performance; see the ~allow-overreads-p~ option to [[#fn-decompress][decompress]]
  and [[#fn-make-decompression-stream][make-decompression-stream]].

- *Performance*: To my knowledge, this is the second fastest Deflate decoder and
  the fastest bzip2 decoder in pure Common Lisp. Under SBCL, file-to-file
  decompression usually hits 1.7x-2.2x the runtime of GNU gzip, 2.5x-3.4x the
  runtime of zlib, and 1.3x-1.5x the runtime of bzip2. It is some 1.6x-2.4x
  faster than [[https://github.com/sharplispers/chipz][chipz]] for Deflate and some 1.3x-1.5x faster for bzip2.
  See [[#performance][the performance section]] for more details.

The other libraries under consideration are [[https://github.com/sharplispers/chipz][chipz]], which is probably the most
popular library, and [[https://pmsf.eu/resources/lisp/Deflate.html][an implementation by Pierre Mai]] that is compact and notably
used by Quicklisp.

** Edge case handling
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: edge-cases
:END:

*** Deflate
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: edge-cases-deflate
:END:

The Deflate spec has a few rough edges which we deal with as follows.

- Some decompressors allow back references to go beyond the beginning of the
  output data, pretending that the octets out of bounds were all zeroes. This
  one always signals an error.

- Huffman trees are uniquely determined by the associated sequence of code
  lengths, but not every such sequence corresponds to a tree - some leave codes
  unassigned and some make codes ambiguous. The spec isn't clear on what to do
  with such sequences (outside of two special cases in §3.2.7). While one can
  argue that leaving codes unassigned is fine as long as they don't appear, we
  always signal an error as soon as a sequence doesn't correspond to a
  (complete) Huffman tree.

- According to §3.2.7, the situation where only a single distance code is used
  may be represented by having only one code length of one. We enforce that the
  unique distance code is always encoded as a zero bit and never as a one bit.

- A dynamic Deflate block can omit the encoding for the end-of-block marker. I
  am convinced that this is an oversight in the standard since the only
  situation where an encoder would want to output such a block is if it knows in
  advance the input is infinite and that the miniscule inefficiency of encoding
  an EOB would be worse than the inefficiency that arises from being unable to
  change the Huffman tree (no EOB means no new dynamic block).

  However, there's little reason to ban this; since Deflate already allows
  blocks of arbitrary length, nothing stops a stream from being infinite anyway
  and a finite input is going to run into EOF either way.

- Dynamic Deflate blocks can provide encodings for the illegal literal/length
  codes 286 and 287 as well as the illegal distance codes 30 and 31, although
  these may never occur in the data. We allow them in blocks since otherwise the
  fixed Deflate block code wouldn't be expressible dynamically.

A more detailed comparison of edge case handling across libraries can be found
below. An /error/ is an error of some library-defined type that could be handled
by a library user; a /basic error/ is something like a failed assertion or
~(error "foo")~, where the problem is explicitly detected but can't be
reasonably handled by a user; an /internal error/ is something like a type error
or an array bounds violation that is signalled by the implementation (but not
necessarily reliably so).

¹ In combination with the behavior for out-of-bounds references, this means that
data with preset dictionaries will silently decompress incorrectly.



*** Bzip2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: edge-cases-bzip2
:END:

Bzip2 has no spec, so we mostly try to match the reference implementation. There
is one notable exception: The reference implementation accepts underfull Huffman
trees and only complains once unassigned codes are used; we reject such trees
right off the bat since it simplifies the code.

I am not aware of any compressor that outputs such trees; Joe Tsai claims they
exist, but provides no names. There isn't a good reason why a compressor would
output such trees since bzip2 cannot have alphabets of size one, and whenever
you have a branch with only one child, it's more efficient to just give the
unique child a code that's one bit shorter. The resulting reshuffling of codes
has negligible overhead (none if you only assign them at the end). I suppose
this case is something to think about once someone runs into it while using this
library.

Chipz is essentially a translation of the reference implementation, but doesn't
bother to support the block randomization mechanism that has been deprecated for
a good two decades. We do because our approach makes it very easy to add. You
can find a test file [[https://semelz.de/files/zero-randomized.bz2][here]]; it consists of 100MB of highest quality zero octets.
The [[https://gitlab.com/bzip2/bzip2-testfiles/-/blob/master/lbzip2/rand.bz2][testfile in lbzip2]] doesn't actually test block randomization since it is too
short for any effects to show up.

Other than this, the format does not allow for many edge cases to begin with
since most of its transformations simply cannot have invalid inputs. Just like
the reference implementation, we do not care about wasteful encodings such as
e.g. defining six Huffman trees despite only using three.



** Performance funny numbers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: performance
:END:

The performance measurements below are taken on an older x86-64 machine, taking
the best of five attempts, using each library's idiomatic method of file-to-file
decompression (i.e. ~copy-stream~ + ~with-open-file~ for semz.decompress,
~decompress~ with pathnames for chipz, and ~inflate-gzip-stream~ +
~with-open-file~ for Mai's deflate). We test Mai's implementation both with
checksums (for a fair comparison) and without checksums (to reflect its
default).

I tried to keep the benchmark files varied since decompression benchmarks are
highly input-dependent, but take the results with a grain of salt regardless. As
a rough baseline, measurements with zlib-1.2.13 and GNU gzip-1.12 are provided,
using the canonical ~zpipe~ example program and ~gunzip~ respectively.

Decompression is a bit diddling domain, so SBCL is unsurprisingly the fastest of
the tested implementations. We primarily optimize for it and notably use a
different implementation of CRC-32.

*** CCL-1.12.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: performance-ccl
:END:

CCL has notoriously slow bit operations, resulting in an overall 6.5x runtime
compared to SBCL and less pronounced differences between libraries. This is
apparently being taken care of currently and I'd expect performance to change
drastically once these fixes land.

This is the only tested implementation where we perform worse, but you'd
probably be better off using ~java.util.zip~ anyway. There are some amusing
aspects to these measurements: Buffering significantly slows down the code but
CRC-32 calculation is at SBCL speeds.

* Reference
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reference
:END:

In what follows, an /octet vector/ is a one-dimensional array containing
/octets/, i.e. integers x with 0 ≤ x ≤ 255. Octet vectors that are passed to the
library need not be specialized or simple; octet vectors that are returned by
the library are always both. When we speak of /bounding index designators/, we
use the term with the same meaning as in Common Lisp, but additionally allow a
starting index of ~nil~ to denote the beginning. Whenever a function takes
optional bounding index designators, the default is to denote the entire
sequence.



** Function: ~decompress~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-decompress
:END:

*decompress* format input
&key start end output-size allow-overreads-p
=> decompressed-buffer, header

- ~format~: A format specifier. See [[#fn-list-supported-formats][list-supported-formats]].

- ~input~: Either a ~binary-input-stream~ or an octet vector.

- ~start~, ~end~: Bounding index designators for ~input~ if the latter is a
  vector. Ignored if ~input~ is a stream.

- ~output-size~: A non-negative integer or ~nil~. The default is ~nil~.

- ~allow-overreads-p~: A generalized boolean. The default is ~nil~.

- ~decompressed-buffer~: An octet vector.

- ~header~: A property list with keyword keys. See [[#fn-decompression-stream-header][decompression-stream-header]].

The most convenient interface to this library. Returns a fresh octet vector that
contains the decompressed form of the ~format~-compressed data in ~input~.

~output-size~, if not ~nil~, should be the predicted size of the decompressed
data. If correct, this prevents unnecessary copying at the end.

If ~allow-overreads-p~ is true and ~input~ is a stream, bytes beyond the end of
the compressed data might end up being read during decompression; enabling this
option tends to significantly improve performance on stream inputs.

In addition to the options listed above, ~decompress~ can
take [[#format-specific-options][format-specific options]].



** Condition: ~decompression-error~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: c-decompression-error
:END:

Direct superclasses: ~simple-error~

General superclass for errors related to decompression. While the error message
gives detailed information about the exact error, we do not distinguish between
e.g. failed checksums, out of bounds references or malformed Huffman trees on
the type level since this information is basically useless to a programmatic
user and usually just an artifact of corruption.

Gross user errors such as passing in invalid bounding index designators or
returning invalid dictionaries from a [[#format-specific-options][dictionary function]] do /not/ signal a
~decompression-error~.



** Condition: ~eof~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: c-eof
:END:

Direct superclasses: [[#c-decompression-error][decompression-error]]

Signalled when the input stream/buffer is exhausted. Notably implies that the
data up until this point was not detectably malformed. Note that even when the
input is a stream, it is /this/ condition which is signalled, not ~end-of-file~.



** Condition: ~unrecognized-zlib-dictionary~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: c-unrecognized-zlib-dictionary
:END:

Direct superclasses: [[#c-decompression-error][decompression-error]]

Signalled when zlib decompression involves a preset dictionary whose checksum
isn't recognized by the dictionary function.

Note: This condition is only signalled when preset dictionaries are enabled.
See [[#format-specific-options][format-specific options]].



** Function: ~unrecognized-zlib-dictionary-checksum~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-unrecognized-zlib-dictionary-checksum
:END:

*unrecognized-zlib-dictionary-checksum* uzd
=> checksum

- ~uzd~: An [[#c-unrecognized-zlib-dictionary][unrecognized-zlib-dictionary]] condition.

- ~checksum~: An ~(unsigned-byte 32)~.

Returns the unrecognized checksum that was encountered during zlib
decompression, in the form [[#fn-adler-32][adler-32]] outputs. See [[#format-specific-options][format-specific options]].



** Function: ~list-supported-formats~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-list-supported-formats
:END:

*list-supported-formats* => list

- ~list~: A list of symbols.

Returns a list of symbols that are valid /format specifiers/, i.e. can be used
as ~format~ arguments to [[#fn-make-decompression-stream][make-decompression-stream]] and [[#fn-decompress][decompress]] to specify a
compression format.



** Class: ~decompression-stream~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: c-decompression-stream
:END:

Direct superclasses: ~fundamental-binary-input-stream~

Gray stream wrapper that can be used for complicated stream processing. The end
of file is considered reached when the underlying compressed data ends and all
associated uncompressed data has been read.



** Function: ~make-decompression-stream~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-make-decompression-stream
:END:

*make-decompression-stream* format input
&key start end allow-overreads-p
=> decompression-stream

- ~format~: A format specifier. See [[#fn-list-supported-formats][list-supported-formats]].

- ~input~: Either a ~binary-input-stream~ or an octet vector.

- ~start~, ~end~: Bounding index designators for ~input~ if the latter is a
  vector. Ignored if ~input~ is a stream.

- ~allow-overreads-p~: A generalized boolean. The default is ~nil~.

- ~decompression-stream~: A [[#c-decompression-stream][decompression-stream]].

The most general interface to this library. Returns a [[#c-decompression-stream][decompression-stream]]
whence the decompressed form of the ~format~-compressed data in ~input~ can be
read. ~input~ should not be modified or read from until ~decompression-stream~
has reached end of file. If ~input~ is a stream, then the caller is responsible
for closing it.

Calling this function will read header information from ~input~, but no
decompression will be performed until data is read from ~decompression-stream~.

If ~allow-overreads-p~ is true and ~input~ is a stream, bytes beyond the end of
the compressed data might end up being read during stream creation and
decompression; enabling this option tends to significantly improve performance
on stream inputs.

In addition to the options listed above, ~make-decompression-stream~ can
take [[#format-specific-options][format-specific options]].



** Function: ~decompression-stream-format~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-decompression-stream-format
:END:

*decompression-stream-format* stream => format

- ~stream~: A [[#c-decompression-stream][decompression-stream]].

- ~format~: A format specifier.

Returns the ~format~ argument used to create ~stream~. ~format~ is always an
element of the list returned by [[#fn-list-supported-formats][list-supported-formats]].



** Function: ~decompression-stream-header~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-decompression-stream-header
:END:

*decompression-stream-header* stream => header

- ~stream~: A [[#c-decompression-stream][decompression-stream]].

- ~header~: A property list with keyword keys.

Returns the header metadata of the data associated to ~stream~. Depending on the
format, the possible entries are as below.

*** Deflate
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-deflate
:END:

Deflate data doesn't have a header.

*** Zlib
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-zlib
:END:

- ~window-size~: The declared window size, in bytes.

- ~level~: The "decompression level", a rough measure of whether speed or size
  were prioritized during compression. Goes from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning fastest
  and 3 meaning smallest.

- ~dictionary~: The Adler-32 checksum (as returned by [[#fn-adler-32][adler-32]]) of the preset
  dictionary, if applicable, or ~nil~.

*** Gzip
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-gzip
:END:

We do not bother converting IDs and enumerations into symbols because this
doesn't meaningfully reduce complexity - the uses for the affected fields are so
niche that someone who wants to use them is probably more familiar with the raw
data than anything we come up with.

- ~textp~: Boolean. If true, the data is supposed to be text and might require
  line ending conversion.

- ~extra-fields~: Alist with two-character-string keys and octet vector values.
  See gzip spec. Note that keys may be repeated; they have the same order they
  had in the file.

- ~filename~: String or ~nil~. Filename of the original file, if provided.

- ~comment~: String or ~nil~. Comment field, if provided.

- ~modification-time~: Integer. Modification time of the original file or time
  of compression, given in Unix time.

- ~extra-flags~: Integer. See gzip spec.

- ~operating-system~: Integer. See gzip spec.

*** Bzip2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: header-bzip2
:END:

- ~block-size~: Integer. The BWT block size in bytes.



** Format-specific options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: format-specific-options
:END:

The following keyword arguments can be passed to [[#fn-make-decompression-stream][make-decompression-stream]]
and [[#fn-decompress][decompress]] for specific formats. They are ignored for all other formats.

- ~window-size~ (deflate): A non-negative integer. Determines how far back
  references can reach; references that go back further result in
  a [[#c-decompression-error][decompression-error]]. The default is 2^{15}, which results in no restrictions
  whatsoever.

- ~prefix~, ~prefix-start~, ~prefix-end~ (deflate): Either ~nil~ or an octet
  vector with optional bounding index designators. If not ~nil~, makes the
  octets in ~prefix~ available to back references as if they were previous
  decompressor output. The default is ~nil~.

- ~dictionary~ (zlib): A function or ~nil~. Implements preset dictionaries. If
  ~nil~ (the default), preset dictionaries are disabled and signal a generic
  [[#c-decompression-error][decompression-error]] when encountered. The easiest way to use this option is
  via [[#fn-make-simple-zlib-dictionary][make-simple-zlib-dictionary]].

  In general, a function must take a single ~(unsigned-byte 32)~, representing
  an Adler-32 checksum as returned by [[#fn-adler-32][adler-32]], and return three
  values ~prefix~, ~prefix-start~, ~prefix-end~ that are used like the options
  of the same name for Deflate. If ~prefix~ is ~nil~,
  an [[#c-unrecognized-zlib-dictionary][unrecognized-zlib-dictionary]] condition is signalled.



** Function: ~make-simple-zlib-dictionary~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-make-simple-zlib-dictionary
:END:

*make-simple-zlib-dictionary* buffers
=> dictionary

- ~buffers~: A sequence of octet vectors.

- ~dictionary~: A function.

Returns a function suitable to be passed as a ~dictionary~ argument for zlib
decompression which recognizes every octet vector in the sequence ~buffers~ and
no others. The vectors should not be modified afterwards. An error is signalled
if multiple vectors with distinct contents have the same checksum.
See [[#format-specific-options][format-specific options]] for details and how to make more complicated
dictionaries.



** Function: ~adler-32~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fn-adler-32
:END:

*adler-32* data
&key start end
=> checksum

- ~data~: An octet vector.

- ~start~, ~end~: Bounding index designators for ~data~.

- ~checksum~: An ~(unsigned-byte 32)~.

Returns the Adler-32 checksum of the given data, in canonical
~s2~ × 2^{16} + ~s1~ form. This function is provided to help with setting up
more complicated zlib dictionaries; see [[#format-specific-options][format-specific options]].
